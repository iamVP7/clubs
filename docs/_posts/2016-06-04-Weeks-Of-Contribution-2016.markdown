Last year Mozilla Tamilnadu community contributors started an initiative  called as weeks of contribution. The main aim of this initiative is to bring first time contributors to contribute to Mozilla Community. We really had great impact in this, around 15 new contributors joined our community and helping to grow us very well. Learn those who joined us last year newly and active [Weeks of Contribution 2015 Report](https://viswaprasathks.wordpress.com/2015/09/06/weeks-of-contribution-impact-on-me-community-part-3/)

We are again bringing this back to bring awesome set of contributors to Mozilla again. Last year we had some difficulties in teaching to our contributors, as we had most of the things in online. This time we are making a small change. We are going to bring Weeks of Contribution near you in different community spaces  and Colleges. Interested people can goto the spaces and learn. As of now the plan is to start on July 1st Weekend and have in the alternative weeks, and trainers will be teaching regarding Localisation, Support Mozilla, Add-ons development, Quality Assurance. 

**As of now community spaces where Weeks of Contribution going to happen are as follows**

- Villupuram(Bodhi Academy)
- Erode (F-infotech)
- Madurai (Community Space)
- Salem (The Salem Startups)
- Vellore (Community Space)

But we are not going to restrict with these places alone, we are inviting contributors who can come forward to teach and help other in their communities to gain knowledge about Open Source Community especially Mozilla Community. You can Submit your details in [Google form](http://goo.gl/forms/h4ScnTIGFVDOOpH73) so we can contact you soon.

**Last Date for Submission:** *15 June 2016*

For Sure we want many contributors to take knowledge to their friends, but we wanted to track how all contributors contribute and also want to assign tasks to everyone who participate.

For convenience & sharing knowledge uniformly we are going to request Trainers to have offline events on Saturdays.

So We are planning to start on July 1st Weekend and plan as follows, but trainers can change dates so will be easier for them to teach.

- July 2nd - Localization
- July 16th - Firefox Nigthly (QA)
- July 30th - SUMO
-  August 13th - Add-ons (using Webextension API)

So for Trainers before event we will training on these areas, the dates as follows

- June 29th - Localization
- July 13th - Firefox Nigthly (QA)
- July 27th - SUMO
- August 10th - Add-ons (using Webextension API)

We are hearing you feedbacks and comments, use **#mozillatn** for community related things you do and **#mozillaTNwoc16** for Weeks of Contribution, so we can track easily
